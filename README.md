# satisfactory-colour-table

### A simple web page with a table of colour codes for use inside Satisfactory (e.g. colour-coded factories) or adjacent projects.

- Item hex codes are based on the dominant colour in the item's sprite.
- Fluid hex codes are taken from the [Satisfactory wiki](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/).
- UI hex codes are taken from the [Satisfactory website](https://www.satisfactorygame.com), in-game screenshots, etc.

Feel free to submit an issue to suggest new colours.

##### Highly messy, very amateur-hour code. It works, so don't judge me <3
